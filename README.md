# Nick-s-WebShortcuts
A small chrome extension build that lets me go to my often visited websites in a button click

# This was made for my own personal use, Thought i might archive it on github.

Please do not request new shortcuts as this was made for my own use (as previously stated)

it is completely open-source; feel free to modify the code and add your own shortcuts
